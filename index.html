Having been a shy child, Mckayla claims to have found her voice through music and jokes that it’s her first language. Since she started, Mckayla has won several awards and competitions for her vocal abilities and conducting skills, as well as having been accepted to some of the most prestigious honor choirs and summer vocal programs in the U.S. Mckayla also plays several percussion instruments and is a feature performer for her high school’s nationally ranked marching band program.</p>
